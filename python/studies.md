# Study configuration and analysis reference

[Python documentation](README.md) · [Project overview](../README.md)

## Run a study

Use a tournament when more than two configurations must be compared. Both tournaments and batches
created with `--output` preserve every action for later analysis.

### 1. Configure and run the tournament

Create `configs/tournaments/boop-study.toml` locally using the TOML example below,
then run it. Personal tournament definitions are ignored by Git. The shared
[`template-study.toml`](../configs/tournaments/template-study.toml) remains versioned
as an executable reference for agent configurations and parameter grids. The Boop
and SPOTF baseline profiles are also included under `configs/mcts/`. Personal study
scripts belong under the ignored `local/` directory.

```bash
meeple-bots tournament \
  --config configs/tournaments/boop-study.toml
```

A configuration defines shared execution settings and enough agent entries or matrix combinations
to produce at least two uniquely named agents:

```toml
game = "boop"
output = "../../results/tournaments/boop-study.jsonl"
matches_per_pair = 20
pairing_mode = "round_robin"
seat_mode = "paired"
seed = 42
max_plies = 10000
workers = "auto"

[[agents]]
name = "random"
kind = "random"

[[agents]]
name = "mcts-h0-10000"
kind = "mcts"
iterations = 10000
rollout_depth = 16
exploration = 1.4142135623730951
rollout_policy = "uniform_random"
# rollout_epsilon = 0.1
use_heuristic = true
heuristic_index = 0
self_play = true
```

The default `pairing_mode = "round_robin"` schedules every distinct pair of agents. The independent
default `seat_mode = "alternating"` alternates their seats while assigning a new seed to every
match. Use `seat_mode = "paired"` to run each seed twice with opposite seats. In paired mode,
`matches_per_pair` counts total games and must be even: `20` means ten distinct seeded positions and
twenty games. Self-play keeps distinct seeds because swapping one configuration with itself would
only duplicate the same match. `self_play = true` adds that same-configuration pairing without
including its games in competitive standings. Different names may intentionally use identical
parameters.

For ordered parameter sweeps, `pairing_mode = "adjacent"` reduces only the internal pairings of
each `[[agents]]` grid. Two variants from the same entry are paired when they differ in exactly one
array dimension and use consecutive positions in that array. Variants from different entries still
use round-robin pairings. For example, a grid with three `exploration` values and two
`rollout_depth` values creates the seven edges of the resulting 3-by-2 grid instead of all fifteen
internal pairs. Array order defines adjacency; values are not numerically sorted by the loader.

Tournament matches use the same thread pool as `Batch`. Set `workers = "auto"` or a positive TOML
integer. The CLI can override the file for one run:

```bash
meeple-bots tournament --config configs/tournaments/boop-study.toml --workers 6
```

Only the main thread updates standings, reports progress, and writes JSONL. Match numbers, seeds,
seats, and trace order therefore remain deterministic even when later matches finish computation
first. The JSONL header records the effective worker count and seat mode. Extraction preserves the
mode in `studies.csv`; paired games can also be identified by their shared pairing and seed.

An MCTS entry independently configures cutoff evaluation and rollout action selection:

```toml
cutoff_evaluator = { kind = "neutral" }
rollout_policy = { kind = "epsilon_greedy", epsilon = 0.1, evaluator = { kind = "game_heuristic", index = 0 } }
```

This example uses heuristic 0 during rollout selection but not at the depth cutoff. The inverse and
combined configurations are valid too. `uniform_random`, `greedy`, `epsilon_greedy`, and `mast` are the
built-in policies. Use `rollout_policy = { kind = "mast", epsilon = 0.1 }` in TOML or
`Mast(epsilon=0.1)` from `meeple_bots` in Python. MAST learns exact action averages per
player within each decision, using terminal results or the cutoff evaluator. It accepts
no rollout evaluator and resets its statistics even when the search tree is reused.
See the [MAST behavior and experiment notes](../agents/README.md#reusable-profiles).
Greedy and epsilon-greedy iterations evaluate legal successors; MAST instead maintains
an action table. These policies have different iteration costs, so
compare policies with the same `time_budget` as well as with equal iterations. A timed decision
finishes its current iteration and can exceed its search deadline. JSONL moves record actual
completed iterations and total agent cost; this total also includes lifecycle work outside the
search budget. Further configuration and grid examples appear below.

A conditional policy can restrict informed selection to a game phase. This SPOTF example evaluates
H0 only for `TakeTile` and `EndCollection`; gemstone actions use the uniform fallback:

```toml
rollout_policy = { kind = "conditional", condition = { kind = "turn_phase", phase = "collect" }, primary = { kind = "epsilon_greedy", epsilon = 0.25, evaluator = { kind = "game_heuristic", index = 0 } }, fallback = { kind = "uniform_random" } }
```

Conditional rollout configuration is preserved in JSONL and `agents.csv`. Turn-phase conditions
are currently supported by SPOTF; other games reject them explicitly.

Progressive Bias can guide UCT while preserving uniform rollouts. This example evaluates each new
child once with H0 during Collect, caches that value, and lets its influence decay with visits:

```toml
progressive_bias = { weight = 0.25, evaluator = { kind = "game_heuristic", index = 0 }, condition = { kind = "turn_phase", phase = "collect" } }
root_diagnostics = true
```

`root_diagnostics` is opt-in because it increases trace size. When enabled, every JSONL move stores
the expanded root actions' indices, visits, mean utility, cached heuristic value, final Progressive
Bias term, and selected flag. `extract` normalizes these records into `root_actions.csv`.

Tree reuse is independently opt-in:

```toml
tree_reuse = true
```

During a match it follows accepted actions from both seats, retains only the reached subtree, and
falls back to a fresh tree when the action was not expanded or the state does not match. JSONL moves
record reuse hits, retained visits/nodes, pruning, and resets; `extract` writes these columns to
Boop `turns.csv` and SPOTF `actions.csv`. The `analyze` command benchmarks isolated positions, so use
a paired tournament to evaluate reuse latency or strength across a continuous game.

Exact-state transpositions are also independently opt-in and can be combined with tree reuse:

```toml
transpositions = true
```

When disabled, the original tree backend is used unchanged. When enabled, equal states share one
node and its accumulated utility, while each action edge keeps an independent visit count for UCT
exploration. `search_nodes` then counts unique states created by the graph search.

An MCTS entry must define exactly one of `iterations` or `time_budget`, plus `rollout_depth`.
Either budget can be an array; `rollout_depth` and `exploration` can also use arrays. Structured
configuration also accepts arrays in `cutoff_evaluator.index`, `rollout_policy.evaluator.index`,
`rollout_policy.epsilon`, and the corresponding `rollout_policy.primary` fields of a conditional
policy. `progressive_bias.weight` also accepts an array. The loader creates their Cartesian product.
For example:

```toml
[[agents]]
name = "mcts-h0"
kind = "mcts"
iterations = [100, 1000, 10000]
rollout_depth = [8, 16, 32]
exploration = 1.4142135623730951
use_heuristic = true
heuristic_index = 0
```

An informed-rollout epsilon sweep remains fully structured:

```toml
cutoff_evaluator = { kind = "neutral" }
rollout_policy = { kind = "epsilon_greedy", epsilon = [0.0, 0.1, 0.25, 1.0], evaluator = { kind = "game_heuristic", index = 0 } }
```

The flat compatibility fields `heuristic_index`, `rollout_heuristic_index`, and
`rollout_epsilon` continue to accept arrays as well.

Generated names append only the fields written as arrays. The suffixes are `i` for iterations, `t`
for time budget, `d`
for rollout depth, `c` for exploration, `h` for cutoff heuristic index, `rh` for rollout heuristic
index, `e` for rollout epsilon, and `pb` for Progressive Bias weight. Inline `analyze` agents also
accept `tr=true` as shorthand for `tree_reuse=true` and `tp=true` as shorthand for
`transpositions=true`. The
example therefore creates names from `mcts-h0-i100-d8` through `mcts-h0-i10000-d32`. Scalar
entries retain their original names, so existing tournament files remain compatible.

Lists must be non-empty and cannot contain duplicate values. One matrix entry can generate at most
256 agents, preventing an accidental quadratic explosion in round-robin pairings. `use_heuristic`
and `self_play` remain scalar; when `self_play = true` is present on a matrix, every generated agent
gets its own self-play pairing. The JSONL tournament header records the fully expanded agents.

Relative output paths are resolved from the directory containing the TOML, not from the current
working directory. Missing parent directories are created. Existing trace files are protected;
pass `--overwrite` only when replacement is intentional or use `--output PATH` for another target.

The JSONL header stores the complete configuration and schema version. Each following line stores
roles, physical seats, seed, duration, result, and full action trace. Because each match is flushed
immediately, completed work remains available if a long tournament is interrupted.

### Decision timing

Decision timing in new traces uses `decision_timing_scope = "agent_total_v1"`:

- `decision_seconds` is total agent wall time attributed to that action.
- `selection_seconds` covers action selection and retrieval of search statistics.
- `maintenance_seconds` covers start, action-update and end callbacks, including tree/graph reuse.
- `decision_seconds = selection_seconds + maintenance_seconds`.

Maintenance belongs to the agent executing it, even after an opponent's action. Pending work is
charged to its next decision; any remainder at match end is added to its last decision. Therefore
final per-agent means and iterations/second include lifecycle overhead. A seat with no decisions
has its lifecycle cost in `result.unassigned_maintenance_seconds`, indexed by seat.
Game-rule transitions, observers, GUI animation delays, serialization and construction outside
the match runner are excluded. Human selection time includes waiting for human input.

Live move observers receive the cost known at publication time; terminal adjustments appear in
the final `MatchResult` and the GUI's completed history. `time_budget` targets approximate total
MCTS agent cost: measured pending maintenance and a finalization estimate reduce the search
allowance, including preparation. Iteration budgets are unchanged. A complete iteration is always
allowed; indivisible operations and final match cleanup can still exceed the target. For equal-cost
comparisons check measured totals. See [budget accounting](../agents/README.md#reusable-profiles).
Older runs used the entire time allowance for the search loop; do not interpret them as results
of this revised budgeting behavior.

`moves.csv` retains all three timing fields. Existing game-specific tables and reports use the
new total through `decision_seconds`. Extracted manifests and reports identify the timing scope.
Historical traces without the marker retain selection-only timing and unknown component fields.
They remain readable, but cannot be combined or resumed with new total-cost studies. Their
missing lifecycle costs cannot be recovered by re-extraction; repeat affected timing comparisons
when total cost is required.

Local Python studies can use the same executor without importing CLI internals:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from meeple_bots import ConnectFour, MctsAgent, RandomAgent
from meeple_bots.tournaments import TournamentAgent, TournamentConfig, run_tournament

config = TournamentConfig(
    game=ConnectFour(),
    output=Path("results/tournaments/my-study.jsonl"),
    pairing_mode="round_robin", seat_mode="paired",
    matches_per_pair=2, seed=42, max_plies=42, workers=1,
    agents=(
        TournamentAgent("control", MctsAgent(iterations=100, rollout_depth=42)),
        TournamentAgent("random", RandomAgent()),
    ),
)
summary = run_tournament(config)
```

`run_tournament` returns a summary and accepts optional `on_start` and `on_match`
callbacks. Console output remains the CLI's responsibility. Both entry points use
the same scheduler, worker pool, seat/seed handling, serialization, and trace writer.

For a study with its own ordering, `match_jobs`, `run_matches`, `tournament_header`,
and `TournamentTrace` expose those same pieces. `TournamentTrace(..., resume=True)`
validates an existing trace against its header and exposes `completed_match_numbers`;
the caller must skip those jobs without changing their original identities. Duplicate
numbers, conflicting plans, truncated records and incomplete results are rejected before
opening the file for append. Results must contain consistent plies/moves, winner/utilities,
finite timings and structured actions. The same validation runs before writing new results.
The writer checks pairing identity, seats and seed against the plan, including paired seeds,
self-play and seed wraparound. Game legality remains the responsibility of native replay during
extraction; resumption does not rerun games.

New headers include ordered `pairings`, making adjacent-grid schedules verifiable. Header equality
is still required. Older round-robin headers can be used unchanged to resume their original plan;
older adjacent headers without a pairing plan are rejected rather than guessed. This lower-level
resumption is for Python study scripts; the CLI still protects existing output and
requires `--overwrite` to replace it. Regenerate analysis using `extract` and `report`.

### 2. Extract analysis tables

```bash
meeple-bots extract \
  --input results/tournaments/boop-study.jsonl

meeple-bots extract \
  --input results/tournaments/spotf-study.jsonl
```

Compatible studies can be combined into one extraction. Inputs may follow one `--input` or repeat
the option:

```bash
meeple-bots extract \
  --input results/tournaments/spotf-study-1.jsonl \
          results/tournaments/spotf-study-2.jsonl \
  --input results/tournaments/spotf-study-3.jsonl \
  --output-dir results/tournaments/spotf-combined/data
```

Batch traces can be extracted alone or mixed with tournament traces:

```bash
meeple-bots extract \
  --input results/batches/spotf-comparison.jsonl \
          results/tournaments/spotf-study.jsonl \
  --output-dir results/spotf-combined/data
```

Multiple inputs must use the same game and tournament schema. An agent name may appear in several
studies only when its kind, iteration/time budget, rollout depth, exploration, and evaluators are
identical.
Conflicting definitions stop extraction before output is written; studies or matches are never
silently excluded. Give genuinely different configurations distinct names before combining them.

Combined matches receive a new global `match_number` while retaining `study_id` and
`source_match_number`. Pairings are likewise renumbered globally. `studies.csv` records every input,
its completion status, and processed match count. `manifest.json` stores the same information in
its `sources` list. The original single-input behavior remains available without `--output-dir`;
multiple inputs require an explicit destination.

Reports over combined data give every recorded match equal weight. When source studies use
different agents or numbers of matches, use the `study_id` column for source-level comparisons and
do not interpret the aggregate win rate as though every agent had faced an identical schedule.

The default output is `results/tournaments/boop-study/data/`. Use `--output-dir PATH` to override
it. Existing known outputs are protected unless `--overwrite` is supplied.

Extraction is available for every supported game. It starts with five generic study tables:

- `manifest.json`: sources, schemas, completeness, table names, and row counts;
- `studies.csv`: one row per source trace, including whether it came from a batch or tournament;
- `agents.csv`: one row per configured agent, with the full recorded configuration in
  `config_json` alongside the usual analysis columns;
- `matches.csv`: game-independent outcomes, seats, durations, and utilities.
- `moves.csv`: one row per ply with its player, agent, outcome, action JSON, decision time,
  search iterations/nodes, root diagnostics, and tree-reuse metrics.

`study_id` is unique within each extraction. It starts with the trace filename stem and,
when already used, receives the next available numeric suffix (including collisions with
original filenames that already contain suffixes). IDs are deterministic for the same ordered
inputs; reordering or combining different inputs may change them. `studies.csv` retains the
source path, and match-level tables reference the assigned ID and original match number.

`config_json` preserves nested evaluator parameters and diagnostics options with sorted object
keys. Only `name` and `self_play` are excluded: the name has its own column and self-play is
aggregated separately across studies. When combining traces, the same agent name must have the
same recorded configuration, including cutoff, rollout, fallback and progressive-bias evaluator
parameters. Object key order and equivalent JSON numbers such as `1` and `1.0` do not cause
conflicts. Missing fields are not filled with today's defaults; use distinct names when recorded
configurations differ. Existing traces retain their original fields and remain extractable.

Analysis schema 8 adds this column. Regenerate old extractions from the original JSONL to recover
parameters that earlier CSVs omitted; there is no need to rerun matches for this correction.

Boop additionally produces:

- `boop_matches.csv`: first graduation and winning mechanism per match;
- `turns.csv`: placements, phases, timings, search iterations/nodes, resolutions, and state metrics;
- `boops.csv`: one row per adjacent-piece interaction;
- `resolutions.csv`: one row per graduation or eight-piece recovery;
- `winning_lines.csv`: final cat-line positions and orientations.

The Boop extractor replays typed actions through the native rules and requires the replayed
winner to match the recorded winner. Its domain metrics come from that replay.

SPOTF additionally produces:

- `spotf_matches.csv`: final scores, tile counts, physical turns, and gemstone totals;
- `actions.csv`: every internal ply with phase, branching, timing/search work, surrounding state,
  reachable H0 progress, category viability, gemstone state, and both ply/tile progress;
- `player_turns.csv`: actions grouped into actual player turns, including aggregate decision cost,
  score/progress deltas, category viability, and gemstone attrition;
- `tile_takes.csv`: spirit, power source, reservation, sacrifice, search cost, and strategic deltas
  for every collected tile;
- `gemstone_actions.csv`: every place, move, or skip decision with game quarter and search cost;
- `categories.csv`: final counts, count gaps, scoring contribution, absence penalties, and lost
  majorities for all 12 categories and both players.

The SPOTF extractor rebuilds the shuffled forest from each match seed. A trace is rejected if any
action is illegal or if its replayed winner or scores differ from the recorded result.

Extraction streams the trace and accepts interrupted studies. It marks the manifest as partial when
fewer matches than declared are available. A truncated final JSONL line is ignored and reported;
malformed records elsewhere are rejected.

Connect Four and tic-tac-toe use the generic tables, with native replay validation of every
completed match. The extractor checks action types and coordinates, active players, legal
transitions and a terminal final position, then compares the recorded winner and both utilities
with Rust's result. Actions after the game ends and unfinished matches are rejected. No game
rules are duplicated in Python. Validation failure does not replace existing extraction files,
even with `--overwrite`. Historical traces undergo the same checks when re-extracted.

A partial study may contain fewer completed matches than declared; an individual match must still
be complete and valid. `complete` describes study coverage, not just whether replay succeeded.
Games with richer analyzers add domain-specific tables without changing the common extraction
contract.

### 3. Generate a tournament report

Report readers preserve identifiers as literal text, including names such as `NA`, `NULL`,
`nan` or `001`. Boop/SPOTF treat only empty CSV cells as missing values, retaining real draws
and absent numeric measurements. To repair affected reports, regenerate them from the existing
extracted CSVs; no match rerun or re-extraction is needed for this reader correction.


Install the optional plotting and statistics dependencies once:

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[report]"
```

Then generate the report:

```bash
meeple-bots report \
  --input results/tournaments/boop-study/data

meeple-bots report \
  --input results/tournaments/spotf-study/data
```

An input directory named `data` produces a sibling `report` directory. Other input names receive a
nested `report/` by default. Use `--output-dir PATH` or `--overwrite` to change that behavior.

Boop and SPOTF have registered report generators. Both accept a partial extraction but label the
result as preliminary. The SPOTF report compares competition, head-to-head results, first-player
advantage, plies versus physical turns, scores, spirit and power-source categories, collection
patterns, gemstone decisions, and sacrifices. It also compares measured MCTS latency, iterations
and nodes per second, budget utilization, search cost by phase, reachable scoring categories, and
gemstone conservation across game quarters. Strategic quarters use collected-tile progress rather
than internal plies. Search-specific figures are omitted when the input has no MCTS decision
metrics.

Connect Four and tic-tac-toe use a shared generic report through the same command:

```bash
meeple-bots report --input results/tournaments/connect-four-study/data
```

It produces `index.html`, `summary.json`, four CSV tables, and up to two figures.
Tables cover W/D/L and competitive score `(wins + 0.5 * draws) / games`, results
by agent and seat, results by opponent, and decision metrics. Decision metrics
include mean/median time, actual mean/median/min/max completed iterations, and
iterations per second. Configured iteration/time budgets are retained alongside
measurements. Missing measurements remain missing, including for random agents;
they are not interpreted as zero iterations. Throughput uses only decisions with
both iteration counts and positive elapsed time.

Competitive summaries exclude self-play; decision metrics include it. Partial
studies are marked preliminary. Scores are descriptive, without confidence
intervals, and aggregate scores depend on the opponents faced. The generic
report requires only the common extraction tables, so no game-specific analysis
or study script is needed. Existing output is protected unless `--overwrite` is
given. Regenerating a report does not rerun matches.

## Study artifacts

The default study layout keeps source traces, derived data, and presentation separate:

```text
results/tournaments/
├── boop-study.jsonl
└── boop-study/
    ├── data/
    │   ├── manifest.json
    │   └── *.csv
    └── report/
        ├── index.html
        ├── summary.json
        ├── figures/*.png
        └── tables/*.csv
```

Competitive report results exclude self-play. Strategic summaries retain it. Boop normalizes
board zones by cell count; SPOTF reports both internal plies and physical player turns.

The JSONL trace is the durable source record. Extracted tables and reports can be regenerated from
it without rerunning MCTS.


Analysis schema 9 adds `selection_policy` to `agents.csv`. Historical MCTS configurations
without that field mean `uct`; the original configuration remains preserved in `config_json`.
UCB1-Tuned studies should change only `selection_policy`, keeping budgets, rollouts, evaluators,
reuse and transpositions equal. The `exploration` setting only affects UCT.

## Automatic MCTS diagnosis

`study` generates and executes a budgeted sequence of paired comparisons from one starting
profile. It uses the existing Rust agents, tournament executor and version-1 traces. It currently
supports Boop, SPOTF, Connect Four, Tic-Tac-Toe and Splendor. Can't Stop still needs public-chance transport
in the generic tournament/extraction pipeline before this command can accept it.

```bash
meeple-bots study --game boop --budget 2h \
  --reference configs/mcts/boop-baseline.toml \
  --output results/studies/boop-generic-diagnosis
```

For Splendor, start a generic diagnosis without an external reference:

```bash
meeple-bots study --game splendor --budget 2h --workers auto \
  --seed 42 --output results/studies/splendor-generic
```

Splendor uses neutral evaluation and uniform rollouts. Native calibration samples public
positions by resolving chance with an independent seeded environment RNG; chance events do
not count as player plies and only decision positions are timed. Tournament traces retain
all refills and are validated on resume. The standard study report and candidate TOMLs are
available; the separate extraction/game-specific reporting pipeline is not registered for
Splendor. Fixed-iteration comparisons may use workers; timing-sensitive comparisons remain
isolated. Equal-time results depend on runtime scheduling even with a fixed seed.

Without `--baseline`, the starting profile is **generic**: 1,000 iterations, depth 32, exploration
1.0, UCT, uniform rollouts, no tree reuse/transpositions, and the first registered heuristic
(or neutral evaluation if none exists). It does not read the game's calibrated baseline.
`--reference` is excluded from calibration parameter selection, screening and rankings; it is
only an external opponent in held-out confirmation. A one-iteration native validation checks
that its configuration is supported before screening starts.

Use `--baseline PATH` to start from another profile. The input profiles are copied into the
output directory and are never edited. The default output is `results/studies/GAME-study`.
Run a release native build for timing experiments (`maturin develop --release --locked`).

The phases run in order:

1. **Calibration:** a short swapped-seat pair against Random estimates game length; an exact
   profile benchmark estimates early/middle/late iteration costs. Random is a sanity check,
   not the quality reference. The game estimates and timing samples are saved.
2. **Mechanisms:** the eight combinations of UCT/UCB1-Tuned, reuse off/on and transpositions
   off/on. Twelve contrasts differ in exactly one factor, exposing background-dependent
   effects without a 28-pairing round robin. They use equal total decision time. Heuristic,
   rollout, horizon and UCT exploration remain fixed.
3. **Iterations:** the two screening leaders use a geometric ladder of ¼, ½, 1, 2 and 4 times
   the calibrated iteration center. All candidates face the same fixed starting-profile
   anchor; adjacent budgets also face each other. This stage changes the computational
   budget deliberately and records actual latency. Ranking graph-neighbor results in the
   mechanism stage is exploratory, not a universal strength ranking.
4. **Parameters:** retain the best mechanism configuration for each selector and compare
   depth ½/1/2 times the starting horizon. UCT also tests exploration ¼/½/1/2 times the starting
   value. This small cross-product measures their interaction at equal decision time, against
   one fixed anchor. It does not tune heuristics, rollouts, MAST epsilon or bias weights.
5. **Confirmation:** new reserved seeds compare two parameter finalists, the iteration
   trade-offs, and combinations of tuned parameters with the balanced iteration count.
   If a reference is supplied, compare parameter finalists against it both at equal time
   and at its original budget; iteration candidates also face the original reference.
   Original-budget comparisons may have unequal computational cost and are labeled as such.

The total budget includes calibration and execution. By default 30/30/20/20 percent of the
post-calibration budget is targeted at the four comparison phases. Estimated costs determine
how many seed pairs fit, capped by `--max-pairs` (default 16, minimum 2). `--decision-time SECONDS`
overrides automatic screening-time calibration. These are runtime estimates, not hard real-time
guarantees: once a swapped-seat pair starts, both matches finish. An insufficient remaining
budget stops before launching the next estimated pair; no partial phase is promoted. A pilot
pair or a slower-than-estimated pair can exceed the deadline. `--max-plies` defaults to 10,000;
exceeding it stops the study with an error rather than counting an unfinished game as a draw.

`--workers N` or `--workers auto` enables bounded match concurrency (default: 1).
The study automatically keeps calibration, every contrast containing a time-limited agent,
and the iteration ladder's fixed-anchor comparisons sequential. The latter supply the isolated
latencies used to select fast/balanced/strong profiles and draw the quality/cost curve.
Other fixed-iteration comparisons (ladder neighbors and eligible confirmation matches) run
in parallel batches. No timed match overlaps those batches. Thus mechanisms and parameter
screening remain sequential; more workers do not accelerate every phase.

For example: `meeple-bots study --game boop --budget 2h --workers 4`.
`auto` uses the existing physical-core-based worker resolver. Reports label each contrast's
worker limit and whether its timings may include CPU contention; parallel timings must not
be interpreted as isolated performance. Worker count is frozen on resume. Budget estimates
conservatively sum pair costs rather than assuming linear speedup, and a started batch finishes
even if it overruns the deadline. Resume accounting does not count overlapping match durations
as sequential wall time.

Within each phase, contrasts share seed blocks and are interleaved by paired round. Each phase has a disjoint
seed range. Different seeds do not necessarily mean different starting boards in deterministic
setup games; they also control search randomness. Selection rules and pairing plans are frozen
before the phase starts, and confirmation never feeds back into screening.

Artifacts:

- `study.json`: frozen phase plans, exact profiles, runtime budget/accounting, revision and
  native/Python fingerprints. The original Git revision is informational: a new commit
  alone does not block resume, but changed native/Python fingerprints do. `baseline.toml` and optional `reference.toml` snapshot the inputs.
- `traces/`: one normal, resumable JSONL tournament per contrast. These work with existing
  `extract` and `report` commands; the new coordinator does not introduce another game trace format.
- `report.html` and `summary.json`: paired outcomes, results by seat (JSON), conservative
  95% intervals, mechanism effects by background, latency, maintenance, reuse, iteration
  throughput by game quarter and a quality/cost plot. The automatic HTML report requires
  only the standard library; richer existing game reports still use the report extras.
- `candidates/`: `fast`, `balanced`, `strong`, timed parameter finalists and fixed-iteration
  `tuned*-balanced` profiles. Identical trade-offs can yield identical candidate profiles.
  These are proposals, not automatic replacements of the game's baseline.

The balanced screening candidate is the least costly one within five **observed** percentage
points of the strongest observed candidate against the fixed anchor. This is a selection rule,
not an equivalence test. Statistical intervals treat an entire seed pair as one observation;
mechanism averages also cluster backgrounds by seed. They use a conservative Hoeffding bound,
remain wide in small studies, and have no multiple-comparison correction. The report explicitly
labels inconclusive results and never calls a non-significant improvement “iteration saturation”.
A held-out advantage supports only the tested opponents, budgets and game settings.

Resume an interrupted or budget-limited study with the same settings and a larger **total** budget:

```bash
meeple-bots study --game boop --budget 4h --resume \
  --reference configs/mcts/boop-baseline.toml \
  --output results/studies/boop-generic-diagnosis
```

Completed games are reused, including the first seat of an interrupted pair. Conflicting inputs,
changed executors/native binaries, missing completed traces and truncated records are rejected.
Raising the budget lets pending phases finish; it does not add seeds to already frozen phases.
Start a new output directory for a larger independent replication or a changed engine.

A small execution check is available, but is intentionally too weak for strength conclusions:

```bash
meeple-bots study --game boop --budget 60s --decision-time 0.0005 --max-pairs 2 \
  --output results/studies/boop-smoke
```
